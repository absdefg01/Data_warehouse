N.B.: When a slide features a blue&yellow band with a star pattern in the upper right corner, it means I consider this as 'supplementary material' and will not ask about that in the exams.




- 15/09/2018: lecture slides uploaded. 
N.B.: Slides that have not been discussed in the lectures yet (chapters 5,6,7) may still be modified (corrections, additions...)


- 26/09/2018: we stopped at slide 154.


- 27/09/2018: added new files
=> script files (exact copy of files in parent directory)
=> connecting-to-oracle.pdf (describes connecting to the Database)
=> a sample of past years papers. This is no guarantee that the exam will be similar this year, but it shows what you may expect. The content of the course and exam conditions (authorized documents, exam length) vary from one year to another.
I do not provide further correction of past year papers. 
Observe that last year the lab exam used actually the northwind database (the very same database that we used in the labs).

- 5/10: we stopped at slide 169.
- 10/10: lab session 1. expect every student to have completed until ex 1.4.3. at least, before 16/10. It is not compulsory (I will not check) but we will have many more questions to tackle during the next lab, so don't lag behind.

-24/10: last lecture. Discussed Bloom filters, indexes (bitmap...), clustering (in particular Z-curve). Materialized views (quickly, won't be at exam).
Federated DB and Mediator Wrapper architectures. In-memory DB.
Slides online are updated, parts kept out of exam have been marked. 

-27/10: lab exam. You won't be allowed to use your own machine. You won't be allowed to connect to internet.
